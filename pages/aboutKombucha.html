        <h2>What is kombucha?</h2>
        <p>Kombucha tea is a fermented beverage that has been consumed for several thousand years, believed to have originated in China or Russia. It is made with a combination of teas, most often green and/or black. The tea is brewed with organic evaporated
        cane juice to feed the SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) in the fermentation vessel. The sugar is consumed by the SCOBY as the tea ferments and becomes kombucha. Additional flavorings (fruits, herbs, etc.) may be added for a
        second fermentation period, providing additional nutrients, flavor, color, and general awesomeness.</p>
        <h3>Is kombucha healthy?</h3>
        <p>People who rave about kombucha’s health benefits are quick to point out that it is rich in probiotics, enzymes, B vitamins, glucuronic acid (a detoxicant), antioxidants through vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene, as well as widely reported benefits
        of improved digestion, blood sugar, and hypertension. While the scientific data are mixed on kombucha’s effectiveness, we know this much: it’s a very tasty beverage that is low in carbs/sugar (approx 2-6 grams per 8oz serving) and low in calories
        – while including absolutely no artificial garbage found in many other beverage options.</p>
        <p>Bottom line, if you're following a low-carb or keto diet, kombucha probably won't be in your regular routine, but for everyone else a glass or two of kombucha on a regular basis is likely to be a welcome treat.</p>
        <h3>But it's brewed with sugar!</h3>
        <p>This is correct. However, the sugar is almost completely consumed in the initial fermentation process. The sugar feeds the SCOBY, not you. Some store-bought brands have considerable extra sugar, so check labels when shopping at your local market.</p>
        <h3>Concerned about the caffeine from tea?</h3>
        <p>We totally understand. Chris, our founder, dropped caffeine completely for several years and is still a proponent of reducing or eliminating caffeine in order to live a more healthful life. Kombucha contains far less caffeine than regular tea,
        with roughly 2/3 of the caffeine content being removed during the fermentation process. Also, kombucha isn’t something you guzzle 32 oz at a time. A 6 or 8 oz glass one to three times a day is plenty.</p>
        <h3>Fermented things scare me. What about mold and safety?</h3>
        <p>Brewers, especially novices, can sometimes run into problems with mold if they don’t follow strict protocols for handling their SCOBY, tea, and brewing equipment properly. At Wild Side Kombucha, we are meticulous and have never experienced a bad
        batch. The good news, for any brewer, however – is that when a mistake happens with a batch of kombucha, it is very easy to identify and is discovered long before bottling.</p>
        <h3>What about alcohol?</h3>
        <p>Kombucha is a fermented product and will contain a slight trace of alcohol content (often between 0.03-0.05%). That’s about the same amount you would get if you fresh-squeezed some orange juice, so party hard folks! All kidding aside, kombucha needs to be refrigerated. Back in 2011, there were distribution problems that led to kombucha staying at room temperature for too long, resulting in a higher alcohol content. It was just high enough to warrant a different level of labeling, taxation, and protocol for sale. At that time, Whole Foods pulled it from the shelves briefly before the major producers re-labeled their kombucha and proper storage was made a standard practice. Bottom line – you decide for yourself whether this is a concern.</p>
        <h3>OK, what about that gross-looking sediment or oogly bits I sometimes see in a bottle of kombucha?</h3>
        <p>The sediment and occasional oogly bits (seriously – there isn’t a better way to describe them) are a great sign of a living beverage. Even after bottling, small bits of healthy bacteria and yeast will continue to grow, eventually beginning to form a new SCOBY – even in your small bottle.</p>
        <p>Rest assured, if you love kombucha, you can drink these little gems and get even more health benefit from your beverage. If you don’t like them, try tipping the bottle over a few times to break up the sediment. Never shake! You can also pour the kombucha through a strainer or a fork to catch some of the ooglies before they land in your glass.</p>
        <h3>Is kombucha carbonated like soda?</h3>
        <p>Kombucha is a naturally effervescent beverage. With that being said, it rarely reaches the carbonation level of commercial beverages such as soda or seltzer water. Some kombucha makers force-carbonate before kegging or bottling, but I do not. My batches often have a very light fizz to them. In reality, even explosively fizzy batches mellow out quickly once poured into a glass.</p>
