        <h2>Take a walk on the wild side with small batch organic kombucha tea brewed in Thetford, Vermont.</h2>
        <h3>The kombucha</h3>
        <p>Kombucha is an ancient beverage, made by fermenting tea under a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, or as it is often lovingly referred to: a SCOBY. While it is fantastic that you can buy it in stores, in my humble opinion, nothing beats
        home-brewed kombucha.</p>
        <p>Wild Side Kombucha is made in small batches in my home in Thetford, VT. The raw kombucha tea is made with a blend of organic black, oolong, green, and white tea leaves. I then produce a range of different flavors by adding a small amount of fruit,juice, herbs, or spices. The end product is a wonderfully refreshing, tasty, and healthful beverage that will rock your world.</p>
        <h3>The brewer</h3>
        <p>My name is Chris Spelman, and I started Wild Side Kombucha out of a love for this amazing beverage and a strong desire to bring great kombucha and happiness to as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>When not steeping tea and mixing flavors, I can often be found mountain biking, snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, walking around barefoot, or teaching myself how to write code.</p>
