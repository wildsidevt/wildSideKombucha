    <h2>Wild Side Kombucha Recipe</h2>
    <h3>There are many ways to make great kombucha at home. This is mine.</h3>
    <p>Brewing kombucha at home can be a deeply satisfying way to pass the time. You will cultivate a living organism and enjoy the many wonderful health benefits of a completely natural beverage, loaded with antioxidants, probiotics, beneficial acids, enzymes, and vitamins. All of this and great taste with remarkably few carbohydrates.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients/Supplies</h3>
    <h4>Makes 1 gallon</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup organic evaporated cane sugar</li>
      <li>6 bags (or tsp if using loose) of tea: 3-4 green, 2-3 black</li>
      <li>SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast)</li>
      <li>8-16oz starter liquid (retain from previous batch)</li>
      <li>Stainless pot for heating water</li>
      <li>Brewing vessel: non-leaded glass or ceramic is best (can also use stainless)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider something like <a href="#">this</a> for batch brewing</li>
        <li>Something like <a href="#">this</a>works very well for continuous brewing</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Cloth or large coffee filter (not cheesecloth) and rubber band to fit top of vessel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process - Single Batch Brewing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 8 cups distilled (not public), spring, or well water to 180 degrees** and remove from heat</li>
      <li>Add tea and steep for 4-5 minutes with cover on to maintain temperature***</li>
      <li>Remove tea and set aside</li>
      <li>Stir in 1 cup evaporated cane sugar until it dissolves</li>
      <li>Stir in 8 cups cold water and test temperature (at or below body temperature, 70-80 degrees is ideal)</li>
      <li>Add sweet tea mixture to brewing vessel, leaving 2-3″ of room at the top</li>
      <li>Add 8-16oz starter liquid and SCOBY to brewing vessel</li>
      <li>Cover with clean cloth and secure with rubber band</li>
      <li>Set in warm, open-air place in home where it will not be disturbed and will not be in direct sunlight (OK if using ceramic or stainless brewing vessel)</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove 1 gallon of kombucha tea from 2+ gallon continuous brewing vessel****</li>
      <li>Heat 8 cups distilled (not public), spring, or well water to 180 degrees** and remove from heat</li>
      <li>Add tea and steep for 4-5 minutes with cover on to maintain temperature***</li>
      <li>Remove tea and set aside</li>
      <li>Stir in 1 cup evaporated cane sugar until it dissolves</li>
      <li>Stir in 8 cups cold water and test temperature (at or below body temperature, 70-80 degrees is ideal)</li>
      <li>Add sweet tea mixture to brewing vessel, leaving 2-3″ of room at the top (OK to pour on top of SCOBY)</li>
      <li>Cover with clean cloth and secure with rubber band</li>
      <li>Set in warm, open-air place in home where it will not be disturbed and will not be in direct sunlight (OK if using ceramic or stainless brewing vessel)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Process - Bottling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>After 7-10 days (single batch, first continuous brew) insert straw below the SCOBY, drawing out small amount (using finger on top of straw to create suction) and taste</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If too sweet, brew for a few more days, checking daily</li>
        <li>If too tart, check sooner with next batch</li>
        <li>Temperature, environment, and karma will influence brew time</li>
        <li>You may also notice that continuous brewers get mature and improved flavor after several brewing cycles</li>
        <li>pH should be below 3.5, ideally around 3.0 (can get test strips from home-brew stores or <a href="#">online</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Gently stir kombucha tea below the SCOBY, if following a continuous brewing method, as doing this will allow balance of yeast to enter your bottles and promote better effervescence</li>
      <li>Store in air-tight bottles and refrigerate</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fantastic wing-top bottles: <a href="#">16oz</a>, <a href="#">32oz</a>
        <li>Growlers: <a href="#">64oz</a></li>
        <li>Note: swing-top bottles provide the best seal and result in better carbonation</li>
        <li>Specialized replacement caps for other bottles can also ensure proper seal under pressure, and better carbonation</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Process - Second Fermentation (optional)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Before bottling, you may add a small amount of chopped/pureed/reduced fruit, spices, herbs</li>
      <li>Limit flavorings to less than 20 percent of the bottle</li>
      <li>Optional: can add 1/4-1/2 tsp cane sugar to second fermentation, as well – to generate extra fizz</li>
      <li>Light infusions (e.g. fruit) pair well with kombucha tea brewed with green tea and stronger infusions (e.g. ginger) pair well with black tea</li>
      <li>Store in a warm and dark place for 1-5 days</li>
      <li>May help to vent (burp) daily to release pressure</li>
      <li>May be wise to store inside tight container in the event of explosion (not kidding)</li>
      <li>After the fruit/flavoring agents have broken down, will appear softer or pulp-like and bubbles may be present</li>
      <li>Filter out unwanted fruit and re-bottle flavored kombucha tea before refrigerating</li>
      <li>Fizz is a difficult thing to produce; remember that you're not trying to produce soda, so be happy with great flavor and consider your fizz a bonus</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Never handle a SCOBY without thoroughly rinsing and/or cleaning your hands first with distilled vinegar</li>
      <li>Always thoroughly sterilize your brewing equipment with boiling water and finally use distilled vinegar as a final rinse</li>
      <li>Do not allow soap or soap residue to come into contact with your SCOBY or kombucha tea – it will kill the bacteria</li>
      <li>Patience is everything – this is a living organism and it requires time to work its magic</li>
      <li>Continuous brewing offers some benefits unattainable with batch brewing (new types of bacteria form after 15 and 30 days that can live in continuous brewing vessel, but no single batch would be palatable after that long)</li>
      <li>*types of tea can vary the end product: black is important for SCOBY health, green is good for fizz and taste</li>
      <li>**water for sweet tea should not be too hot (170 for green, 190 for black, somewhere in between for mix) – should see a large number of very small bubbles in the water and just start hearing the sound of the water getting close to boiling</li>
      <li>***Steep times vary – shorter for green or black and longer for oolong</li>
      <li>****For continuous brewing, it is perfectly fine to refrigerate 1 gallon of sweet tea, then replace one or two glasses every day that are drawn from your continuous brewer, if this is what you would prefer</li>
      <li>*****Initial brews will take longer, but mature and thicker SCOBYs will tend to brew a bit faster</li>
      <li>Each new brew generates a “baby” on top of your SCOBY “mother” and at some point, you may wish to remove some of the babies</li>
      <li>You can store extra babies/SCOBYs in a “hotel” (same as single batch brewing vessel, but with air-tight top to slow SCOBY growth – simply add some kombucha tea once in a while to keep them from drying out)</li>
      <li>Better yet, you can give your SCOBYs away and spread the love</li>
    </ul>
